This is the Vuex container for the Vue.js web application. Vuex is a state management library for Vue.js applications that provides a centralized location
for managing application state. The repository is defined by a state object that contains application state, getters to retrieve state, mutations
that update the state, and actions that are asynchronous actions and mutations to update state are performed

The state object in this store has several properties, such as darkMode and colorBlindAssist which are used to control the look of the application,
coursesById which is an object that maps course IDs to course objects, isLoadingCourses which means the course is currently loading, selectedSemester
with its current semester selected, Semesters with available courses, subsemesters with available subcourses, and departments with available departments.

The getters in this repository define functions that retrieve data from the state. The COURSES getter returns a list of course objects, while
the GET_COURSE_BY_ID getter takes the course ID as an argument and returns the corresponding course object. The darkModeState and colorBlindAssistState
getters return the darkMode and colorBlindAssist values, respectively.

The changes in this repository define the operations that update the state. The TOGGLE_DARK_MODE switch changes the darkMode value,
while the SAVE_DARK_MODE switch stores the darkMode value in a cookie. The RESET_DARK_MODE mutation clears the cookie and sets
darkMode to the value of the browser's preferred color scheme. The TOGGLE_COLOR_BLIND_ASSIST mutation changes the value of
colorBlindAssist and stores the value in a cookie. The SET_COURSES mutation accepts an array

I can comprehend the code segments individually, but I don't know how exactly to write the code to would setup local storage for time filter function.
